# Nuitee hotel booking chatbot

This AI-powered chat bot is built with OpenAI's API and uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the frontend and a Node & Express server for the backend to provide a conversational interface for users. It is designed to understand natural language and respond in a meaningful way. It takes user input, parses them and returns an object that can be reused with Nuitee API to fetch a list of hotels. 

It's a very early alpha that'll superseded by the plugin system.
